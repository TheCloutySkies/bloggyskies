Hours upon hours of reading and watching tutorials finally brought me to a bike. The Poseidon Redwood. It was a fairly new bike that came up on the market at the time. It was light, durable, had a sturdy and prepped frame for lots of mounting options, and most importantly it was budget friendly. I was able to get it on sale for $749. I really lucked out because most bikes in the bike touring spaces get real pricey, real fast. Now a fair warning, if you order this bike online like I did, you’ll have to assemble the bike yourself. I believe I had to attach the handlebars, front wheel, seat post and seat, pedals, and the chain. By the time you finish, you’ll already know your bike pretty well.</p><p> </p><p>Now what about my sustainment? How am I supposed to carry 75 pounds of gear with me? Bags. Lots of bags. In a typical bike touring setup there are bags mounted all over a bike. The biggest bags, called panniers, were mounted on the left and right sides of my rear rack. The word pannier actually comes from an old English word for bread basket. After a bunch of online deliberations, I eventually chose the Ortlieb Back Roller Classics. Pretty much the Lebron James of bike panniers. Actually a fun fact; I named my bike, <em>Bichael Jordan.</em> If Mike is short for Michael; then Bike must be short for Bichael. But that’s aside from the point here. I also decided to buy my handlebar bag from Ortlieb, mostly because I was going to keep my camera in it and I wanted to make absolutely sure it would not get wet. And let me tell you that both of my Ortlieb products did a mind blowing job of keeping my stuff dry. Those bags have been through 30 degree nights and 105 degree days, torrential downpours and weeks of sun, crashes, drops, hundreds of miles worth of dust and dirt, and they held up magnificently. For the rest of my gear I would say that they were, very water resistant, but when you are in the great plains with nowhere to hide from a whole days onslaught of rain. You start to see where you gears’ weak points are. Like with the Ibera Trunk Bag I had a period of time in Rapid City, South Dakota where it, no joke, rained for nearly 3 days non stop. I made the mistake of leaving it out on a picnic table, naively assuming it was waterproof from previous experiences with shorter periods of precipitation. Long story short, I found out what a fish tank would look like if they had zippers. So if you gleam any lessons from this, if you can afford to invest in vetted, more expensive gear. <strong>Do it.</strong> All together if you were to buy the same stuff that I did, and brand new, the price would come out to be close to $5000. That being said though, about three quarters of this stuff I bought used online and I probably paid about half of that hypothetical $5000.</p><h2>Bike Specific Equipment</h2><ul><li><strong>Bike:</strong> Poseidon Redwood Dropbar - Large (I got it on sale for $749)</li><li><strong>Rear Rack:</strong> Ibera PakRak - $54.99</li><li><strong>Trunk Bag:</strong> Ibera PakRak - $69.99</li><li><strong>Pannier Bags:</strong> Ortlieb Back Roller Classic - $215.00 (pair)</li><li><strong>Frame Bag:</strong> Blackburn Outpost - $89.99</li><li><strong>Salsa EXP Anything Bag</strong> - $52.00 (each)</li><li><strong>Blackburn Anything Cage</strong> - $35.00 (each)</li><li><strong>Handlebar Bag:</strong> Ortlieb Ultimate Six - $140.00</li><li><strong>Seat:</strong> Selle Royal Float - $45.99</li><li><strong>Seat Bag:</strong> Topeak Aero - $29.99</li><li><strong>Generic Handlebar Cup Holder</strong> - $12.99</li><li><strong>Wild Man Top Tube Bag</strong> - $19.99</li><li><strong>Headlight:</strong> Gearlight S400 - $19.99</li><li><strong>Tail Light:</strong> Cygolite Hotshot - $39.99</li><li><strong>Tire Pump:</strong> Rehook Air (sooooo slow) - $34.99</li><li><strong>Marspeeder Phone Mount</strong> - $21.99</li><li><strong>Bike Multi-Tool:</strong> Vibrelli V19 - $29.99</li><li><strong>Metric Allen Wrench Set</strong> $15.99</li><li><strong>Walmart Tire Repair Kit</strong> $9.99</li><li><strong>Hafney Bar End Mirror</strong> - $24.99</li></ul><p>Let’s talk a little safety. When it comes to lights, there’s three things to think about. Battery, brightness, and ruggedness. For a headlight, get a rechargeable light with a metal housing and it wouldn’t hurt to get multiple. I had two headlights on my setup, one mounted horizontally to the flatbar and another mounted vertically on the drop bar portion that I used for extra coverage or as a flashing light depending on the conditions. For rear lights, I think I had 4 different lights. One main flashing light that was extremely bright. In addition to that I had several, colorful accent lights pointed in different directions to make my bike more visible and easier to identify as a bike.</p><p>In Bozeman, Montana I transformed my bike into the highly visible and highly annoying; Rave Bike. I bought a handful of cheap kayak and decorative LEDs to mount all over my bike and set them all to flash in different colors. Then every time I had to roll through a town or city during the nighttime, I would set my Bluetooth speaker to full volume and blast techno and brostep music through all the quiet neighborhoods I passed through. During my Rave Bike era I also wore a high visibility, reflective vest which I recommend you to have if you aren’t planning on going full rave mode.</p><h2>Camping Gear</h2><ul><li><strong>Tent:</strong> Naturehike CloudUp-1- $159.99</li><li><strong>Sleeping Bag:</strong> Teton Leef 0 Degree- $89.99</li><li><strong>Sleeping Pad:</strong> Big Agnes Air Core Ultra - $79.99</li><li><strong>Sleeping Pad Pump:</strong> Big Agnes Pumphouse Ultra - $34.95</li><li><strong>Pillow:</strong> Nemo Fillo - $39.99</li><li><strong>Woodland Camo Scrim</strong> - $20.00</li><li><strong>Stove:</strong> SOTO Windmaster - $64.95</li><li><strong>Foldable Solar Panel</strong> $40.00</li><li><strong>Bear Spray</strong> - (gifted)</li><li><strong>Cold Steel Tanto Knife</strong> $49.99</li><li><strong>Approx.

When I had to wild/stealth camp I would always sleep with my fixed blade knife, flashlight, phone, and bear spray right next to my head. Luckily I never had to use any of my self defense tools on any animals or humans. I did once wake up to the sound of rustling on the side of my tent. I groggily picked my head up slightly to see if I could figure out what curious little critter was looking for food in my camp as I did make myself some beef stew earlier that day.</p><blockquote><p><em>Hmmmpf</em></p></blockquote><p>My fight or flight sense activated without warning. It took my still half asleep brain a second or two to figure out why it was suddenly ready throw hands.</p><blockquote><p><em>Hmmmpf, sniff sniff</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Oh that’s a bear.” I thought to myself</p></blockquote><p>The heavy breathing and powerful snuffling were unmistakable. In northern Montana, (Around Eureka) that meant one thing: grizzly bear. They can smell food from over 20 miles away. <em>Maybe I shouldn’t have made that beef stew</em>. I figured this was going to happen sooner or later so I weighed my options. I read somewhere that you should made a bunch of noise to startle the bear away. I also happened to read in a separate article that that was a great way to get mauled. Another article advised turning on your flashlight inside your tent to surprise and confuse the bear away. I also had a sneaky suspicion that course of action could cause the bear to become a little TOO curious. Turns out there’s a lot of ways to die to a bear, who would’ve thought. But eventually after careful and nervous consideration, I made up my mind. I looked at my watch and it read about 5am in the morning. I put my earbuds in and fell back asleep about 5 minutes later. I woke up a couple hours later with no sign of the bear anywhere. Now I’m not saying that ignoring the danger is the best course of action but I suppose it’s a lesson that preparedness doesn’t exclusively refer to the tools and gadgets. I had the proper gear but still decided to take a more passive route to decrease the chance of bleeding out in a nylon coffin. This story is also a testament to how comfy my sleep setup was. My Big Agnes sleeping pad is one of those big, inflatable ones. It packs down small, it’s so comfortable, and surprisingly rugged. My sleeping bag was actually sometimes a little too hot and did not pack down as well, it actually ended up taking half of a pannier bag worth of space. My favorite part of my setup though had to be the Nemo Fillo, a half inflatable/half foam pillow. I packs down incredibly well and you can adjust it for your preferred head position. I even used it to sleep on cold, hard concrete in the Hollywood streets. Heck I still use it in my bed now.</p><h2>Additional Equipment</h2><ul><li><strong>Anker 20W USB C Power Strip</strong> - $29.99</li><li><strong>Multi-port USB Charging Brick</strong> - $14.99</li><li><strong>Power Banks:</strong></li><li><strong>2x</strong> 10000mAh - $19.99 each</li><li><strong>1x</strong> 20000mAh - $29.99</li><li><strong>Cameras:</strong></li><li><strong>Nikon D5300</strong> - $699.99</li><li><strong>GoPro Hero 10 Black</strong> - $349.99</li><li><strong>Jabra Elite Active 7 Earbuds</strong> - $179.99</li><li><strong>AirPods Pro</strong> $249.99</li><li><strong>Sony XB-33 Speaker</strong> - $148.00</li><li><strong>Garmin Instinct Watch</strong> - $199.99</li><li><strong>iPhone 13</strong> - $699.99</li><li><strong>Salomon X-Ultra 3 Shoes</strong> - $149.99</li><li><strong>Vans UltraRange EXO</strong> - $89.99</li><li><strong>US Army Dust Goggles</strong> - $29.99</li><li><strong>Rite in the Rain Notepad</strong> - $8.99</li><li><strong>Padded Cycling Shorts (NWT)</strong> - $45.99</li><li><strong>Marmot Rain Jacket</strong> - $99.99</li><li><strong>North Face NanoPuff Coat</strong>$99.99</li><li><strong>4 pairs of socks</strong></li><li><strong>5 pairs of underwear</strong></li><li><strong>2 pairs of shorts</strong></li><li><strong>A pair of joggers</strong></li><li><strong>4 T-Shirts</strong></li><li><strong>Toiletries</strong></li><li><strong>Gorilla Tape</strong></li><li><strong>Approx.

For me, I started out simple: a couple of yellow t-shirts with the sleeves cut off as my riding shirts and one pair of padded bike shorts. They weren’t the tight, Tour De France kind. More rugged, with a tough exterior that held up the entire trip. They dried out pretty quickly too, which was a bonus.</p><p>Later, I switched out the t-shirts for some breathable tank tops made for more athletic purposes. I got them cheap at Walmart, and honestly, they worked great. You don’t need to drop a ton of money to stay comfortable on a bike. You’re going to be hot and sweaty no matter what, so you might as well wear stuff you don’t mind trashing. I also brought plenty of breathable, stretchy underwear and only packed Merino wool socks. Merino wool is awesome, it keeps your feet warm when it’s cold, wicks away sweat when it’s hot, and adds a nice bit of cushioning, especially if you end up doing some hiking after a long day of riding.</p><p>I had a couple of extra t-shirts for off days and hanging out in town. Weirdly, I only brought one pair of pants, but it worked out fine. For shoes, I relied on my Salomon boots. Fun fact: as I’m writing this segment in December 2024, I’m still wearing the same boots I started my bike trip in. They’ve got thousands (and I for real mean thousands) of miles on them, and somehow, they’re still going strong.</p><p>When it rained, I had a Marmot rain jacket that did the job. If you’re getting a rain jacket, make sure it has pit zips. Sweating inside a raincoat is so much worse than getting a little wet from the rain. I’d rather deal with rain than feel like I’m in a portable salt sauna. I also brought a puff jacket that could pack into itself, which was super convenient. I didn’t use it much since I was biking in the summer, but it was nice to have just in case.</p><p>For gadgets, one of my best finds was this small Anker power strip. It packs down tiny, and I used it to charge everything; lights, portable chargers, my phone, and even a Bluetooth speaker. Speaking of portable chargers, bring more than one. Trust me, having multiple is a lifesaver. I also tried using a portable solar panel strapped to my trunk bag. Honestly, it didn’t work as well as I hoped, even though it was in the sun all day. It was honestly pretty cheap so that’s probably on me.</p><p>When it came to laundry, I carried one of those travel-sized detergent bottles that you can find at Dollar Tree or really any grocery store. My trick? Every time I stayed at a Warm Showers house, I’d refill it. Same deal with shampoo and body wash; I just made a mix of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in one bottle to save space. Another pro tip: double-check that the caps on your bottles are tight. Once, I hit a big bump, crashed, and later discovered that all my clothes were soaked in detergent. I had to wear the same clothes that I had on for a couple of days until I could wash everything. Lesson learned.</p><p>One random but clutch thing I brought: U.S. Army-issued dust goggles. I packed them for the desert in case of sandstorms (yeah kind of random but who knows), but they ended up being great for mountain passes. When you’re bombing down a hill at 30 to 35 mph, bugs are a real problem. The goggles saved me from getting smacked in the eyes, which, let’s be honest, is kind of important when you’re going that fast with nearly zero protection.</p><p>Oh, and here’s a solid water tip. If you’re using disposable water bottles, suck the air out, crush them down to take up less space. Then, before you hit a stretch where there’s no access to water for a while, just blow them back up and fill them up at a gas station. It’s an easy way to carry extra reserves for those long, dry gaps between towns.</p><p>Okay, I think that’s about all I’ll get into about the gear I used. I want to make this book equally readable for potential, former, and non travelers alike. So I won’t dive into anything too specific but I did my best to highlight gear I enjoyed and valued using. There will be more gear oriented tips and whatnot later on in the coming pages I’m sure. So why don’t we move onto the next section I suppose.</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 20, 2026</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2FTheCloutySkies.github.io%2Fbloggyskies%2Fhow-i-prepped-for-a-130-day-long-bike-ride.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2FTheCloutySkies.github.io%2Fbloggyskies%2Fhow-i-prepped-for-a-130-day-long-bike-ride.html&amp;via=%40cloutyskies&amp;text=How%20I%20prepped%20for%20a%20130%20day%20long%20bike%20ride" class="js-share icon brands fa-x-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/authors/lonnie-johnston/" class="invert" rel="author">Lonnie Johnston</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>© Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script><div class="pcb" data-behaviour="badge" data-behaviour-link="#cookie-settings" data-revision="1" data-config-ttl="90" data-debug-mode="false"><div role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="pcb-title" aria-describedby="pcb-txt" class="pcb__banner"><div class="pcb__inner"><div id="pcb-title" role="heading" aria-level="2" class="pcb__title">This website uses cookies</div><div id="pcb-txt" class="pcb__txt">Opt out for your convenience.
