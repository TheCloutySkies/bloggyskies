I was a sophomore in high school when the pandemic hit us. My friends and I initially were so excited to be out of school early. The first two weeks or so were awesome; video games, Discord calls, and making plans for YouTube videos and overly ambitious films. It all served as a distraction from the real world consequences of the pandemic. We spent the summer of 2020 hanging out, trying to execute our video plans, and other teenager tomfoolery. When weeks became months and the pandemic restrictions still didn’t seem to be lifting, the more it felt to us that maybe the world really was ending. So naturally as dramatic teenagers we decided the best course of action was venturing into the woods, which we started doing in early 2021 after school.<!-- notionvc: b2f68e96-d515-441f-b593-0d96d84fa5d7 --></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0793.jpeg\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0793-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0795.jpeg\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0795-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0796.jpeg\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0796-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0797.jpeg\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0797-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0798.jpeg\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/IMG_0798-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The above photos were taken on July 31, 2021, this version of the Outpost took about 5-6 months of intermittent construction using pallets, cinder blocks, tarps, sheet metal, vinyl siding and anything else we could get our hands on.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\" data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/20230429_212728_4792D8.jpeg\" data-size=\"1512x2016\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/20230429_212728_4792D8-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/F5F2A84A-45D9-4D23-9066-0A6BC4B4D922.jpeg\" data-size=\"744x992\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://TheCloutySkies.github.io/bloggyskies/media/posts/2/gallery/F5F2A84A-45D9-4D23-9066-0A6BC4B4D922-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><!-- notionvc: 64da3af4-c9ac-40ec-a0dc-9267da079cae --></p>\n<p>The Outpost could fit about 8 people with gear. In the beginnings we didn’t have a lot inside just some food, water, fire making supplies, and extra bedding for overnight stays. A buddy of ours had some extra flooring from a recent home renovation which we used by nailing into our uneven pallet floor. Another essential purchase we made was a propane space heater, we were able to sleep surprisingly comfortably during below freezing temperatures in the winter. Eventually we added a fireplace (which only blew smoke into the room with no heat), a porch, small outdoor gym, a fence, parking spots, a running sink, and cardboard insulation. <!-- notionvc: ac55aaac-3fee-4de6-b002-4b985b14622a --></p>\n<p>Our parents had various names for the place, Hobo Hut, The Shelter, The Cabin in the Woods, a campsite. To us though, this was a home away from home. Something that felt truly ours in a world that felt so eager to control us in these pivotal years of our emerging lives. Some of my best memories with my best friends happened in that couple of wooded acres.</p>\n<p>I don't want to fill this post with many regrets but I do wish we make more of an effort to write in our Outpost journal. Intermittently we would remember that it existed and we would assign someone to make a short entry. Subjects would range from improvements, skinwalker encounters, to reminiscing on the good ole days. Luckily I was able to get my homie to send pictures of all the pages and I transcribed them here for anyone to read. The inner cover contained a small database of everyone's birthday and this quote which truly summed out how we felt about the place, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">“A beacon of hope and imagination. A creative outlet for all of us. A place to feel safe and a place where we all belong.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From there we have various entries spanning several years.</p>\n<hr>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">4-27-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sitting at this table, makes me reminisce about the old days. When everyone was accountable, and I never felt alone. This place was a safe-haven in the summer. But those days are gone in this place feels like a graveyard of drifting memories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">5-12-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today is the hottest day of the year so far. Progress needs to be made for the expansion of the outpost. I long for the days of old when progress was always happening. Memento Mori.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">5-25-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">A decently productive day we officially started sparring for our tournament on May 9th/13th, 2023. The skin walkers are getting worse. We attempted to make contact today, it was a partial success. We will need to experiment more. Combat skills need to be improved before we make initial contact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">6-1-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">War has been waged some goofy goobers have decided to vandalize home. The “moon‘s out goons out” phase has been initiated for the outpost. Offensive and defensive measures have been taken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">8-2-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Happy birthday, Griffin!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">9-1-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The friend group is separating, the intervals between visits are lengthening. The outpost survived a storm with 80 mile an hour plus winds. Brent‘s hair looks fire. We need to come out here more often to keep home healthy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">10-14-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Today was productive. The whole is about halfway done. We trekked up to the ridge at night. Noises all around the leaves are falling. The night was cold, but we survived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">10-20-2022</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">First day back of the outpost in about three months, I’ve missed this place so much and now I am back! I feel at home. The sounds of the leaves and the birds chirping in the distance or sounds that I’ve been lying to hear. It’s great to be back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5 class=\"p1\">3-17-2024</h5>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Life moves fast, no matter how long we are gone, this place still feels like home. To be honest, not a lot of progress has been made in the last year. The outpost has been serving more as a safe place to isolate from the world. <strong>You don’t have to think about tomorrow here. </strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">5-9-2025</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">I am the only one here, the outpost is in ruins. Several walls have been breached from what seems to be raccoons. I am writing in pencil because the pen has been chewed through. I don’t think I can possibly clean and fix all of this, but I can try. Everything is strung out chewed through ruined or pooped on. All good things come to an end. All things come to an end even dreams. I’m going to miss this place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: e47b3554-8753-4c7d-bf6f-81e93bfefab3 --></p>\n<p>From what I heard from my friends now is that the Outpost is in a sad state of disarray. There’s holes in the tarps and animals have found there way in and I know that eventually the nature around will reclaim the land we once borrowed for those few wonderful summers.</p>\n<p><!-- notionvc: 46e1b98e-bd80-47a9-bb1d-818591e2f19a --></p>",
